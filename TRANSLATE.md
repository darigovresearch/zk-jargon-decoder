# Translation Guidelines for ZK Jargon Decoder

Thank you for contributing to the translation of ZK Jargon Decoder. Please follow these guidelines to ensure consistency and quality in translations.

## General Guidelines

1. **Use a PO Editor**: Always use a PO editor like [Poedit](https://poedit.net/) to edit `.po` files. Do not edit them by hand. This ensures correct encoding and formatting.

2. **Consistency**: Maintain consistent terminology throughout the translation. If you're unsure about a term, check how it's been translated in other parts of the document.

3. **Code Blocks**: Do not translate content within code blocks unless absolutely necessary.

4. **Uncertain Translations**: If you're unsure about how to translate something, it's better to leave it in English and add a translator's note explaining the difficulty.

5. **Cultural Context**: Be mindful of cultural differences and adapt examples or explanations when necessary, while maintaining the original meaning.

6. **Formatting**: After editing, run `dprint fmt po/xx.po` to ensure consistent formatting.

## Specific Instructions

1. **Technical Terms**: For technical terms specific to zero-knowledge proofs, consider whether to translate them or keep them in English. If you translate, provide the English term in parentheses on first use.

2. **Acronyms**: Generally, keep acronyms in their original form. Explain them if they're not common in your language.

3. **Links**: Do not translate URLs, but do translate link text if it's meaningful.

4. **Images**: If the project includes images with text, discuss with the maintainers about possibly creating translated versions.

## Review Process

1. Self-review your translations before submitting.
2. Be open to feedback from reviewers and be prepared to make revisions.
3. If you disagree with a review comment, explain your reasoning clearly and politely.

## Getting Help

If you have any questions or need clarification on any aspect of the translation process, please don't hesitate to ask in the project's issues or discussions area.
